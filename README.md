# RNA-seq Practice Notebook

Hey all! This repository is my personal learning log and sandbox for RNA-seq data analysis.
I'm not aiming for a polished final product here. I'm documenting my process, questions, and adaptations as I figure things out.

## Goals
- Learn the RNA-sez analysis pipeline step by step
- Reframe existing protocols in ways that make sense to my brain
- Capture missteps, breakthroughs, and alternate mental paths _transparently_

## Structure
- 'report/': Contains the Colab notebook where I'm working through the pipeline
    - Notebook includes a table of contents to separate:
        - What I'm learning
        - My tinkering + interpretations
- 'data/': Placeholder for small example datasets or links to real data (not uploaded here)
## Status
In progress! Currently still in the beginning stages. 
If you stumble across this and have suggestions or corrections, feel free to let me know!
